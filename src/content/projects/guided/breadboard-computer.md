whatItIs: |-
  Two courses on building an 8-bit computer from scratch: one based on a 6502 microprocessor, and the other based on (basically) nothing but logic gates and jumper wires. 

  [Ben Eater](https://eater.net/about) is an incredible educator and expositor, and his journey from college dropout to network engineer to lead content creator at Khan Academy and finally to self-sufficient YouTube creator is extremely inspiring to me. I aspire to communicate technical topics with his level of clarity and calmn.
whatILearned: |-
  - How the basic logic gates (AND, OR, XOR, NOT, etc.) can be put together into fundamental combinational/sequential logic circuits like adders, decoders, registers, and counters.
  - How these fundamental circuits can combine into larger modules like ALUs and RAM, which can be synchronized with a common clock and transfer data between each other over a common bus. 
  - How microcode instructions are implemented in ROM, and then how executable programs can be made from sequencing these instructions. 
  - Finally, how implementing control flags and conditional jump instructions make the system Turing complete by introducing a feedback machanism into the computing process.
otherNotes: |-
  I have to admit that didn't *actually* do the builds for either of these - [the parts kits](https://www.youtube.com/@BenEater/store) are just a bit out of my price range for a hobby project based on my current income. A big advantage of the other projects was that writing code is free. (for now, at least! ;) )

  However, I *did* follow all 25+ hours of course material very intently with a lot of additional outside reading, and the work I've done with digital logic circuits and microcontrollers in the past made me feel right at home with the content.

  I can confidently promise that once I find gainful employment, this will be one of the first things I get for myself and I look forward to updating this note once I've built the projects for real.
