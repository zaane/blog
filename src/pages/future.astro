          <p>
            I am seeking employment in a junior or mid-level software
            engineering role. I am happy to work on any part of the stack and
            with any technology, not limited to those mentioned on this website.
          </p>
          <p>
            Right now I'm interested in databases, distributed systems, and
            UI/UX.
          </p>

        <div class="beyond">
          <h3>...and beyond</h3>
          <p>
            My current goal really is to find a job where I can start getting my
            hands dirty and trying to make an impact — that's how all the great
            programmers I know got so good at it.
          </p>
          <p>
            But I also have dreams of one day helping revolutionize education
            with free and open source technology. I think we are still in the
            early days of software, and I hope in my lifetime to help bring it
            into the future.
