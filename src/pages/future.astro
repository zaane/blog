          <p>
            I am seeking employment in a junior or mid-level software
            engineering role. I am happy to work on any part of the stack and
            with any technology, not limited to those mentioned on this website.
          </p>
          <p>
            Right now I'm interested in databases, distributed systems, and
            UI/UX.
          </p>

        <div class="beyond">
          <h3>...and beyond</h3>
          <p>
            My current mission is to keep skilling up and becoming the great
            engineer I know that I can be. All the great ones I know got that
            way from working full-time for many years on a variety of projects,
            so I'm eager to start at a company where I can do the same.
          </p>

            But I also have dreams of one day revolutionizing education with
            free and open source technology. I think we are still in the early
            days — really, of software in general, but of educational software
            in particular. I hope in my lifetime to help bring it into the
            future and out of the hands of for-profit institutions.
