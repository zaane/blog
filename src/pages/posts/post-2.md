# second post

published on 2026-01-18

this is actually just a copy of the first post :)

## what I've done so far

made the website (hardest part is getting started?)

## what's next

1. **flesh out 'about me'**: write a more detailed about page
2. **host and link to projects**: host one or more of my portfolio projects and link to them on a "portfolio" page
3. **blog about projects**: type out and expand on dev logs to tell the story of project development
