              Trained in physics and mathematics with a passion for solving hard
              problems and communicating technical ideas, I’ve spent the last
              few years helping others learn: from Calculus, Physics, and
              Chemistry to English, Psychology and World History.

              My passion for learning brought me to studying foreign languages,
              and then to learning software development to try to make the
              process easier for myself. Now I'm building educational software
              and trying to make learning easier for everyone.
