              Trained in physics and mathematics with a passion for solving hard
              problems and communicating technical ideas, I’ve spent the last
              few years working as a tutor and teacher of various subjects,
              helping others learn some of the things I know: anything from the
              theorems of calculus and the mysteries of thermodynamics to the
              subtleties of English grammar and the drama of the French
              revolution.
            </p>
            <p>
              My passion for learning brought me to studying foreign languages,
              and then to learning software development to try to make the
              process easier for myself. Now I'm building educational software
              and trying to make learning easier for everyone.
